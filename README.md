# **Mr. README.md**



Hello there!

I'm @the1lastwish (he/him) and I've been a software developer, primarily in C# and SQL, for about 8 years now but new to GitHub!

This place will likely be under construction for a bit, I do plan on hosting some personal projects here while I seek new employment.

That being said if anyone is looking for a quick-learning, hardworking software developer please reach out to me here or drop an e-mail [here](mailto:daniel.mcelhaugh@gmail.com)

¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
